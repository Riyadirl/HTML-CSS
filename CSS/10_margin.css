/*CSS margin is a property used to control the spacing around an element.
It defines the space between the outer edges of an element and its adjacent elements. The margin property can be set to a single value,
 multiple values, or even negative values to achieve different spacing effects.

The margin property can be applied to all four sides of an element (top, right, bottom, and left),
 or individual sides can be specified separately.*/

.my-element {
    /* Margin with a single value */
    margin: 10px; /* Sets equal margins of 10 pixels on all sides */
  
    /* Margin with two values */
    margin: 5px 10px; /* Sets top/bottom margin of 5 pixels and left/right margin of 10 pixels */
  
    /* Margin with three values */
    margin: 5px 10px 15px; /* Sets top margin of 5 pixels, left/right margin of 10 pixels, and bottom margin of 15 pixels */
  
    /* Margin with four values */
    margin: 5px 10px 15px 20px; /* Sets top, right, bottom, and left margins individually */
  
    /* Margin with auto value */
    margin: auto; /* Centers the element horizontally within its container */
  
    /* Negative margin */
    margin: -10px; /* Creates an overlap effect by shifting the element 10 pixels outside its normal layout flow */
  }
